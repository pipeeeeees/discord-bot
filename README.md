## Usage
The bot runs permanently on my home server. Chat with it by messaging `Pipes Bot#8120` on Discord (ID 924431531777359943). Try the following commands:
- `$pollen`: to see Atlanta's pollen count
- `$gas [state]`: to see average state gas prices. Replace [state] with a state name or 2-letter initials
